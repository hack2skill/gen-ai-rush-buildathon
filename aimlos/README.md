# Gen-Ai-Rush-Buildathon

#### Team Name - AIMLOS
#### Problem Statement - Harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Federated Learning without compromising data privacy, PII security, and regulatory compliance. Existing methods fall short in ensuring privacy during model training, data aggregation, and collaboration among multiple entities, leaving businesses exposed to risks and stifling innovation. The industry urgently needs a sophisticated, secure, and responsible solution

## A Brief of the Prototype:
  <b>GenFusion</b> is an enterprise platform designed to bridge this gap. Combining generative AI, collaborative learning, and robust privacy controls, GenFusion empowers businesses to leverage LLMs responsibly. From local training with privacy controls to federated learning and secure aggregation, it ensures compliance and security without sacrificing utility.

  <b>Solution Overview:</b>

  GenFusion revolutionises the field of responsible AI through the following key solutions:

  Localised Training with Robust Privacy Controls:

  GenFusion offers advanced user interfaces that equip clients with differential privacy controls and allows them to test these controls locally during model training. This ensures that sensitive information is protected right at the source.

  2. Responsible Decentralised Intelligence:

  GenFusion embraces the power of Federated Learning, enabling multiple entities (Internal/External) to collaborate on model training without exposing their data. It facilitates secure aggregation of model updates, ensuring that the individual data privacy is maintained during collaboration.

  3. Real-time Compliance & Documentation:
  GenFusion's compliance module auto-generates documentation that details the privacy controls implemented, the testing conducted, and the protection measures taken to prevent data leaks. This fulfils regulatory requirements and helps businesses remain compliant with global privacy regulations like GDPR.


  4. Continuous Monitoring & Evaluation:
  After the model is trained and deployed, GenFusion's monitoring tools continuously evaluate model behaviour for signs of PII leakage or any other vulnerabilities, providing ongoing security assurance.

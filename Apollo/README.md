# Gen-Ai-Rush-Buildathon

## README.md must consist of the following information:

#### Team Name - Apollo
#### Problem Statement - mr.AI is a AGI-model that allows the user to have real-time natural conversations in custom environments with a AI generated character that has it’s own personality and knowledge regarding the given prompt.
#### Team Leader Email -

## A Brief of the Prototype:
  mr.AI is an advanced AI-powered 3D simulation model with real-world live interaction capabilities to facilitate effective between users and the AI powered Character. The model offers an immersive and intuitive interface that allows users to interact with the simulated environment in real-time and receive personalized feedback and response unlike text-to-text conversations.

## Tech Stack: 
  - Unity Game Engine
  - C#
  - InWorld API
  - LLAMA
       
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  Run the executable file called inworlteest.exe. This will open up a game with a text box. Make sure to have the microphone switched on working.

  Click the text box, and type a prompt and press ENTER. Remember that you can only talk to the characters by standing in front of them directly. To get back to the prompt area, just press "q". Currently, the prompt with the following keywords will work:
  - interview:
    - Example: prepare me for an interview
    - This will teleport you to a world where the interviewer will be to the left of the camera. Approach him directly with the use of WASD keys and mouse movements. You can start the conversation by saying anything, for example "Good morning".
  - cafe:
    - Example: create a cafe environment where I am the receptionist dealing with a rude customer.
    - This will teleport you into a world with the rude customer right in front of you. Fly behind the customer, and initiate the customer.
  - patient:
    - Example: help me deal with a stressed out patient.
    - This will bring you right outside a room. Go around the corner, and you will find him right there with a stressed out face.
    - Tip: Start you conservation by saying: "Good Evening, how are you today?" -> This will give an interesting but kinda sad response.
  - hackathon:
    - Example: help me deal with questions asked by a jury in a hackathon
    - This will teleport you into a place with three rooms. Go to the last room and you will find yourself. Yep, it is a Judge of the GenAI Rush Hackathon. The response will be not the best, due to the lack of time to train. But we think you will like it.
    - Tip: "Good evening. I am ready to talk about my project"
  - ai:
      - Example: get me an ai teacher
      - This will teleport you into a school. It is tricky to find this particular charachter. We suggest you to fly up a little and peek into the room immediately to the right.
      - Careful, he is very enthusiastic about AI and ML.
  
## What I Learned:
   - Game development in Unity Game Engine.
   - How to import and use assets in Unity.
   - Leart how to train the charachters in InWorld API to let them have their own characterstic and personality.

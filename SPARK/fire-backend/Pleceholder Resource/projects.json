Since each individual has a unique fingerprint, this method of using fingerprint as a means of authentication to access your ATM is safer and more secure than using an ATM card. Users need not carry their ATM cards with them at all times – they can use their fingerprint to access ATM services. ",

      "description": "When it comes to communication and imaging systems, you need to incorporate the highest level of security in place. Without a reliable and secure system, there’s a massive threat to sensitive data. Cybercriminals and hackers are always on the lookout for hacking into confidential data, which puts it at risk of being violated. ",

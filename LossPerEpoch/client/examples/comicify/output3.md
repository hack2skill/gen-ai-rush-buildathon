## Function Explanation
The code snippet exports a default function called `handler`. This function takes two parameters, `req` and `res`, which represent the request and response objects respectively.

Inside the `handler` function, the response object `res` is used to set the HTTP status code to 200 (OK) using the `status` method. The `json` method is then called on the response object to send a JSON response with the following data: `{ name: 'John Doe' }`.

## Dependencies
The code snippet relies on the Next.js framework. You can find more information about Next.js API routes in the [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

## API Specs
No specific API specs are mentioned in the code snippet.

## Schema Tables
No schema tables are present in the code snippet.

Please note that this documentation provides an overview of the code snippet and its functionality. For more detailed information and usage examples, refer to the official Next.js API Routes documentation.

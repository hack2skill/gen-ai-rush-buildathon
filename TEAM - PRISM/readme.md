Team Leader Email ID : poojalh2003@gmail.com
 
A Brief of the Prototype:
The Integrated Medical Diagnostic Assistant (IMDA) is an AI-driven platform designed to revolutionize medical image processing and diagnostics. This platform utilizes advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to assist healthcare professionals in analyzing medical images quickly, accurately, and efficiently. IMDA aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce workload, and enhance patient outcomes by providing a powerful tool that can assist radiologists and other medical specialists in making more informed decisions.

A robust platform that enables end to end access of individual's medical reports including medications (in case prescribed) to the allocated medical staff/s and the patient with fundamental features like storage of all their medical records and medications. The platform also provides an accurate prediction for the disease.

Generative Al In Healthcare
Assisted or Automated Diagnostics: Chatbots can converse with the help of Al with patients to diagnose a disease or help doctors in diagnosis
Prescription Auditing: By analyzing a patient's medical records and EHR/EMR data can generate flawless prescriptions and suggest course of treatment and medication.
Privacy & Security: Use of Generative Al in Healthcare raises concern about protecting patient privacy and sensitive medical data.

Bias: Generative Al algorithms can be prone to bias if they are trained with data not representing the population they are intended to serve and give incorrect results.
Misuse and Over-reliance: Improper training of Generative Al algorithms can lead to harmful medical impact. Also over reliance on Al can make the medical professionals lose their independent ability to diagnose.

Diagnosis and implementation of liver segmentation using 3D Slicer involves using the 3D Slicer software platform to process and analyze medical imaging data, such as CT or MRI scans, to segment the liver region from the rest of the abdominal organs. Liver segmentation is crucial in various medical applications, including surgical planning, liver disease assessment, and treatment evaluation. Here is a brief overview of the steps involved in liver segmentation using 3D Slicer
1.	Loading Data into 3D Slicer: Once the preprocessing is complete, the medical images are imported into the 3D Slicer software platform.
2.	Region of Interest (ROI) Selection: In 3D Slicer, the user defines a region of interest (ROI) that encloses the liver. This ROI helps narrow down the segmentation process to the specific area of interest.
3.	Liver Segmentation: 3D Slicer provides various tools and algorithms for liver segmentation. One common method is the use of semi-automatic or automatic segmentation algorithms, such as region-growing, thresholding, or active contour models. These algorithms use intensity or texture information to identify the liver region.

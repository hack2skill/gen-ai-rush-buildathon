# Gen-Ai-Rush-Buildathon

## README.md must consist of the following information:

#### Team Name - The Turing Tribe
#### Problem Statement - Create a solution to automate testing for software applications developed, ensuring enhancements in quality and reliability of software applications in real-time scenarios.
#### Team Leader Email - umanglsinghal@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype: This section must include UML Diagrams and prototype description
  The Prototype is in 2 parts: 
#### 1. UI Playground/Sandbox : Users to make twitches to the parameters and capture results of AI Driven/Manual Input unit test cases scenarios.
#### 2. End 2 End Automation : The final solution, integrated with Github Actions where automated unit/functional test case scenarios powered by AI are evaluated through Validation Pipeline.

## Tech Stack: 
#### AWS Lambda Functions (Serverless Backend)
#### HTML, CSS & JS (UI Playground)
#### Github Actions (End 2 End Automation)   

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain a set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype so that it can be tested and deeply analyzed
  
## What I Learned:
The prototype emphasized the transformative impact of AI-driven testing and automation in software development. Integrating AI-generated test cases, seamless code management, and continuous monitoring accelerated the SDLC, reducing manual effort and enhancing software quality. This experience solidified AI's potential to revolutionize testing and development.

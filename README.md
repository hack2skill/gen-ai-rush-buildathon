## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Briefly is a Slack bot that provides concise and actionable digests from selected channels. Its main purpose is to help users stay informed and on top of their game by delivering relevant information without the noise of long messages and threads. It proves to be invaluable for higher officials, product managers, and all employees, as it lists action items and summarizes updates, feature launches, management announcements, and more. By using Briefly, users can prioritize tasks and avoid getting overwhelmed by the flood of messages in Slack. The bot offers the flexibility to customize the updates, allowing users to include only their preferred channels and receive them at their preferred time. Overall, Briefly empowers users to stay efficient and well-informed in their Slack communication.

## What I Learned:
   During the hackathon, my most significant learning came from developing the prototype. I discovered the power of integrating advanced analytics tools and the LLM (Large Language Model). The combination allowed us to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of data and generate meaningful summaries and action items. The experience taught me the immense potential of AI-driven solutions in streamlining processes and making informed decisions, which was truly eye-opening and inspiring.Amid the intense 2-day hackathon, managing stress and fostering team building were vital aspects of our success

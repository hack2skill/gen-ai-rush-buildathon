## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Osteoarthritis is a joint disease impacting millions worldwide 
WHO is 2019 said that there are 528 million people worldwide living.
In India, about 150 million people have osteoarthritis,while 32.5 million in United states suffer from it. 
They go through a lot of pain like Joint pain, morning stiffness, pain during movement, pain at rest 

As Osteoarthritis can you detected through X-Rays it can be also caused due to many other factors. 
The combination of X-rays and related factors such as obesity, age, height, bone density can help us detect 
Product Solution (1-3 Slides)
What the machine does it takes the X-ray input from the user and puts it through the model after that the model categories the X-ray as the severity of the patient 
After the process id done it combines it with other factors like the weight, age, height, bone density which gives us end results also by using OpenAI we created a prompt where when user puts all this info it gives them suggestions about the Osteoarthritis. 
Differentiations (USPs)
Considering various factors that can also lead to Osteoarthritis and create accurate results.
Higher accurate results 
Prompt where you can get tailored solution according to the severity of Osteoarthritis

User Interface => User Uploads the X-Rays => User gets seventy grading => User is asked with more details such as gender, age , weights  => all parameters along with it gets passed => a report is generated 


  
## Tech Stack: 
  TensorFLow
  Gradio
  OpenAI
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  Run the Model step by step no other thing needed
  
## What I Learned:
   There are many people who suffer with this and with this we can help people out also with medical we need to consider lots of aspects and overall view

# Gen-Ai-Rush-Buildathon

## Submission Instruction:
  1. Fork this repository
  2. Create a folder with your Team Name
  3. Upload all the code and necessary files in the created folder
  4. Upload a **README.md** file in your folder with the below mentioned informations.
  5. Generate a Pull Request with your Team Name. (Example: submission-XYZ_team)

## README.md must consist of the following information:

#### Team Name - Jarv
#### Problem Statement - Develop a Text-to-AR system that generates personalized 3D models from text prompts,       enhancing user engagement and creating user-friendly AR experiences.
#### Team Leader Email -krrgupta1201@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype: Unleash your creativity with ARText2Model - an AI system that turns text into intricate 3D models for immersive AR worlds. Effortlessly bring your imagination to life in the AR landscape with our cutting-edge NLP and computer vision techniques. Simple, seamless, and captivating.
  
  
## Tech Stack: 
   Python
   Flask
   Point-e
   Express
   Html&Css&JS
   Ar.JS
   Vanta.js
   Pytorch
   Plotly
   Ngrok
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  1) Navigate to the Backend Folder
  2) Start the Backend Server by running Gan.ipynb
  3) Now run the index.html file through live server
  4) Enter the textual prompt into the UI
  5) Now the 3d obj file will be created based on the text prompt and display it in the 3d AR Environment

  Pre-built Examples:
    Give Chair or Lamborghini and watch as the AR Model of it will be created

  PS: By Default a cube will be generated if the model was not able to match the textual prompt.
    To see the actual 3d model, <b>Navigate into the Gan.ipynb file and change the textual prompt to your needs.</b>

  
## What I Learned:
   We Learnt about a lot of new technologies such as Point-e, Ngrok and many more.

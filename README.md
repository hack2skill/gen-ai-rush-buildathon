## A Brief of the Prototype: 
  The Prototype is in 2 parts: 
#### 1. UI Playground/Sandbox : Users to make twitches to the parameters and capture results of AI Driven/Manual Input unit test cases scenarios.
![Sandbox](https://github.com/Rajveermathur/gen-ai-rush-buildathon/assets/63655047/c38673d8-e276-42b2-b22f-dde9503ff966)

#### 2. End 2 End Automation : The final solution, integrated with Github Actions where automated unit/functional test case scenarios powered by AI are evaluated through Validation Pipeline.

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain a set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype so that it can be tested and deeply analyzed
  
## What I Learned:
The prototype emphasized the transformative impact of AI-driven testing and automation in software development. Integrating AI-generated test cases, seamless code management, and continuous monitoring accelerated the SDLC, reducing manual effort and enhancing software quality. This experience solidified AI's potential to revolutionize testing and development.

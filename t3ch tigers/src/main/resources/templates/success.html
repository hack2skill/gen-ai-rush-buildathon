        <p>Generative AI, also known as generative adversarial network (GAN), is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the creation, generation, and production of new data. It involves the use of machine learning techniques to generate content that appears to be indistinguishable from the data it was trained on. 

Unlike other AI approaches that focus on classification or prediction, generative AI models aim to produce new and original content, such as images, music, text, or even realistic deepfake videos. It typically involves a two-component system consisting of a generator network and a discriminator network, which work in a competitive manner. The generator creates new examples, while the discriminator tries to differentiate between real and generated examples.

Generative AI has been used for various applications, including art and design, content creation, data augmentation, and simulation. It has also raised ethical concerns, particularly with regards to the potential misuse of the technology for creating fake or misleading content.</p>

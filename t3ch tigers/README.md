# Problem Description
The proposed idea is to address the critical challenge of ensuring compliance with security policies, standards, and baselines. The proposed project will focus on developing a system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for compliance monitoring and enforcement. By analyzing logs from relevant sources, the system aims to effectively check for adherence to security policies and standards. This comprehensive approach involves examining system configurations, access controls, and user privileges. The power of LLMs, like ChatGPT or open-source alternatives, will be harnessed to automate the process of identifying non-compliant activities. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights for remediation, streamlining the compliance process and enhancing overall security measures.
